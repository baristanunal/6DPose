        "**TASK OVERVIEW**\n",
        "This project aims to explore and implement advanced techniques for 6D pose estimation using RGB-D images. The goal is to build an end-to-end pipeline for estimating the 6D pose of objects by initially replicating a model that uses just RGB images. The pipeline will then be enhanced by incorporating depth information to improve accuracy in the pose predictions. You will adapt and implement the methodology, starting from pose prediction and then extend the model with your own innovative improvements.\n"
